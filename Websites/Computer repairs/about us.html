                    <p>Something to note about the Computer Repair Shop, we&rsquo;re not exactly salesmen &amp; we&rsquo;ll never win the computer salesmen-of-the-year award, although a big enough trophy could prop the door open in summer.</p>
                    <p>To be honest, we&rsquo;re not that interested in trophies. Chocolate hobnobs however, are a different story!</p>
                    <p>What does interest us though, is offering the good folk of Northampton a professional computer and laptop repair service that&rsquo;s all done inhouse.<br>
                      We obviously need to pay the bills, but we care more about helping people, than we do about money.</p>
                    <p>We&rsquo;re not &ldquo;fly-by&rdquo; wanna be techs with just a mobile number. Our workshop in St. James  has been there for close to 15 years and the company nearly 20 years. Oh, we&rsquo;ve also had the same phone number since then too.</p>

                      <p>Viruses, malware and spyware have become a serious threat, with the real nasty ones either stealing your banking details or encrypting your files than demanding a ransom.</p>
                      <p>They can silently infect while trying to steal your passwords, credit card numbers, and your identity. We have specialist tools to remove them, and will recommend an antivirus to keep you safe in the future. Viruses, malware and spyware are the most common causes for your computer to act strangely or start operating slowly. If you&rsquo;re receiving annoying pop-ups or maybe your hard drive is constantly working away. These are just a couple of signs that your computer could be infected with spyware.</p>

                      <h3>Re-installing the operating system</h3>
                      <p>Computers can slow down because of the increase in software, plugins, and adware that gets installed over time. Viruses can cause irreparable damage to system files requiring a reinstall.</p>
                      <p>If we think you&rsquo;re better off with a re-install, we can back up your data, format your hard drive and reinstall the operating system. You should avoid running a &ldquo;factory reset&rdquo; on your own unless you&rsquo;ve recently backed up. Factory resets can and will delete your personal files and can on albeit rare occasions make things worse.</p>
                      <p>We have well proven methods to reinstall with all the latest updates and service packs whilst preserving your data. Many people compliment us by saying their computer runs faster than when it was new. We can re-install XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.</p>

                      <p>If you&rsquo;ve recently purchased a new computer and need your files transferred from your old one, we can help. We&rsquo;ll transfer your photos, documents, music, and setup email accounts from your old computer to your new computer.</p>
                      <p>If your old computer doesn&rsquo;t boot or start-up, we can also attempt to recover the files. We also include the setup and tune up of the new computer, meaning we&rsquo;ll remove the trial software, do the windows updates, and install Anti-Virus software for you.</p>

                      <h3>Upgrades</h3>
                      <p>Upgrading certain components is a great way to extend the life of your machine for a few more years without investing in a new one. In most cases installing more memory, a new hard drive, and/or a new video card can speed up your system. The biggest upgrade for a surge of performance is to install a SSD (Solid State Drive), this is a hard drive that has no moving parts and is vastly faster than a standard hard drive.</p>
